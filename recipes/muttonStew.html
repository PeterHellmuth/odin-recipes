    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When I visit the land of mortals, my favorite dish is always mutton stew. I don't know what it is about this particular animal but they are as delicious as they are fluffy.</p>
    <p>With just thirty minutes of your time you too can eat as if you are in the land of mortals and pretend the worries of Asgard don't exist.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds of cubed mutton</li>
        <li>15 cups of boiling water</li>
        <li>1 bone (any species)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Place mutton meat in boiling water.</li>
        <li>Just joking start boiling the water with the meat already in it over a fire first, I know you brought cold water, remember I'm Odin I see everything.</li>
        <li>Go find a bone, I know you forgot to get one.</li>
        <li>Throw the bone in the boiling water with the mutton.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Allow to boil for 5 hours.</li>
    </ul>
